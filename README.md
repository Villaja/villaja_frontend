# Frontend Repository for the Villaja E-Commerce marketplace Project

This webapp was developed using Javascript using react.js as the framework for its frontend and node.js as the framework for its backend and mongo DB for its database management.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
The webapp is already hosted and you can visit the domain name below to check out the web app;
